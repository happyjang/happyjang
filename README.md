👩🏻‍💻 I am a software engineer with a proven ability to deliver quality results in both creative and collaborative settings. Prior to transitioning to software development, I was an assistant program director in the number 1 radio station in Thailand for 10+ years. I used my creativity to develop radio content and marketing strategies to maintain the highest rating with more than 1M audiences per hour and the highest advertising revenue of 60% in market share. 

👩🏻‍⌨️ I am passionate about creativity and collaboration for software development. Embracing this passion led me to graduate from a 1,000+ hour coding bootcamp, which focused on JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I am eager to bring my work ethic and team-first mentality to a collaborative, innovative engineering team, wherein I can continue to contribute on a high functioning, results-driven team.
